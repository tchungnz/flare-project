Flare
=================

Flare is a social app for sharing spontanous moments around you.

Users can create flares by taking a photo, adding a caption, choosing to send publicly or just to friends before sending their flare into the sky.

Other users can see these flares on a map, click to see further details and directions and choose whether to come or not. Flares only last for 30 minutes and users can only have one active flare at a time.
